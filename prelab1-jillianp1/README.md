Prelab work for lab 1
Wrote code to print the values of argv[] and argc entries. Then created functions to print the stack frame as a linked list. Created a function to print stack contents from p to the frame of main(). Then on a hard copy of my own print out, I identified the stack contents as LOCAL VARIABLES, PARAMETERS, stack frame pointer of each function.
